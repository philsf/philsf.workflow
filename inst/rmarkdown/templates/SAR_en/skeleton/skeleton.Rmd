# Context

## Objectives

# Methods

[Analyst Note: This methods section provides a minimal description for the convenience of the reader (design, outcomes, exposures, and a concise statistical methods paragraph). It is compatible with the SAP snippet, and covers that deliverable for BASIC packages. Higher packages will include a SAP as a separate document]

[Analyst Note: DOCUMENTATION TIER ALIGNMENT REQUIRED]

- BASIC/STANDARD: delete the mention to a SAP (not scoped)
- PREMIUM: keep the reference to the Full SAP

The full details of the data procedures, study design, and statistical analysis methods used in this report are described in the annex document **SAP-yyyy-NNN-XX-v01**.

## Study Design

[Analyst Note: High-level summary of the study design (e.g., RCT, Observational Cohort, Case-Control).]

## Exposures and Outcomes

[Analyst Note: High-level summary of the primary exposure(s) and the primary/secondary outcomes analyzed.]

## Statistical Analysis

This analysis was performed using statistical software `R` version `r getRversion()`.

# Results

## Baseline characteristics

```{r tab_desc}
tab_desc %>%
  as_kable(
    caption = "**Table 1** caption"
  )
```

```{r fig1, fig.cap="**Figure 1** caption"}
# ![Age](../figures/outcome.png)
# knitr::include_graphics("../figures/outcome.png", error = FALSE)
```

## Primary Analysis

This section presents the results for the primary objective.

```{r tab_inf}
tab_inf %>%
  as_kable(
    caption = "**Table 2** caption"
  )
```

## Secondary Analysis

[Analyst Note: remove this section if not scoped]

This section presents the results for the secondary objectives.


## Exploratory Analysis

[Analyst Note: remove this section if not scoped]

This section presents the results for any post-hoc or exploratory findings.

<!-- ## Sensitivity Analysis -->

<!-- Sensitivity analysis was performed to verify the robustness of the primary findings. -->

# Observations and Limitations

# Conclusions

# References

# Appendix

## Exploratory data analysis

[Analyst Note: Use this section to discuss initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) that informed the primary model selection (e.g., initial variable distributions, correlation checks). Include Figure A1 below.]

```{r A1, fig.cap="**Figure A1** Distribution of age in the study population."}
# ![Age](../figures/distr_age.png)
# knitr::include_graphics("../figures/distr_age.png", error = FALSE)
```{r fig_appendix_eda, fig.cap="**Figure A1** Additional figure (e.g., secondary outcome distribution plot)."}
# Figure A1: Example of an Exploratory Data Analysis Plot (created by 91_outputs_plots.R)
# knitr::include_graphics("../figures/Figure_A1_Age_by_Sex.png", error = FALSE)
```

## Modeling Strategy and Diagnostics

### Model Validation and Diagnostics

[Analyst Note: Use this subsection to detail the model's appropriateness and assumption checks based on the stock diagnostic routine (e.g., collinearity (VIF), influence/Leverage, and goodness-of-fit). ]

[Analyst Note: DOCUMENTATION TIER ALIGNMENT REQUIRED]

- BASIC: Summarize the minimal checks (R2, Outliers, Critical VIF > 10).
- STANDARD/PREMIUM: Document model-specific assumption tests (e.g., Normality, Homoscedasticity, Goodness-of-Fit) and specialized checks (e.g., Cox PH) if applicable.
Describe the findings of the diagnostic plots (if generated internally via functions like autoplot() for residual analysis).

### Model Selection and Justification

[Analyst Note: If multiple models were tested (e.g., adjusted vs. raw, nested), use this subsection to provide the justification (e.g., based on R-squared, AIC, ANOVA, or clinical relevance) for the primary model presented in the Results section.]

[Analyst Note: DOCUMENTATION TIER ALIGNMENT REQUIRED]

- STANDARD: Provide the Draft SAP justification for model selection (e.g., based on ANOVA/R-squared or clinical relevance).
- PREMIUM (Diagnostic Audit): Document the decision-making process for assumption violations (e.g., choice of robust standard errors, outcome transformation) and any complex collinearity interpretations.
