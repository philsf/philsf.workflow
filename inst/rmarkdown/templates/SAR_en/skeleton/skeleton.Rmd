## Baseline characteristics

```{r tab_desc}
tab_desc %>%
  as_kable(
    caption = "**Table 1** caption"
  )
```

```{r fig1, fig.cap="**Figure 1** caption"}
# ![Age](../figures/outcome.png)
# knitr::include_graphics("../figures/outcome.png", error = FALSE)
```

## Primary Analysis

```{r tab_inf}
tab_inf %>%
  as_kable(
    caption = "**Table 2** caption"
  )
```
